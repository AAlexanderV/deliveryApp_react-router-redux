In order to use FAVOURITES and SHOPPING-CART buttons, you need to register.
Default user for test purposes is:
User-email: ivan@gmail.com
Password: 123

Cart button on the top shows number of types of items added to the cart, but does not count number of each type of item added. Each press on cart button on the item list adds a product to the cart or increases a quantity of this product in a cart. You can revise quantity in /account/cart/ or delete item.

For your protection "Continue and Pay" button is currently not active =)
